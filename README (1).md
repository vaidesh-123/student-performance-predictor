# Student Performance Predictor 🚀

Predict student performance for EduQuest Coaching using machine learning, enabling timely intervention and data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview
Uses academic data (study time, previous scores, attendance) to forecast student performance for targeted support.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Forecast student performance using ML models.
- Identify underperforming students for timely intervention.
- Aid EduQuest Coaching in data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Data Loading & Exploration
- Data Preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Model building:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation:
  - R² Score
  - MAE
- Result visualization

## ✅ Results
The initial model achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting student outcomes.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- More data collection for generalization.
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Deployment as a live dashboard.
